                    I worked on having more variety between my outputs. I added random colors to my leaves. I also added more tree types, and
                    allowed for a random number of forest layers to be generated. I will start to play around more with branch color and thickness,
                    and tree variety to increase the variety between the outputs. See sample outputs below.
                    <a href="sketches/forest/index.html">Here</a> is my sketch.

                    I found a bunch of resources on different trees that can be generated using L-systems and dumped them in
                    my <a href="https://www.are.na/share/lcjCjPc">are.na channel</a>.
                    For my <a href="sketches/forest/index.html">forest generator</a>, I worked on incorporating a few different
                    tree types using L-systems, using the resources I found. I also started to incorporate leaves into the trees,
                    and randomizing the leaf colors (see sketch image below). For my metadata, I am thinking of including the following user inputs
                    to change the different tree variables:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age of forest → Heights of trees/ Number of trees</li>

                        <li>Season → Color of leaves</li>
                        
                        <li>Forest type → Types of trees</li>

                        <li>Temperature and precipitation → Number of layers/variety of trees</li>
                    </ul>

                <p> I researched more about L-systems and the different types of trees I would be able to generate.
                    Links to resources I found are on my <a href="https://www.are.na/share/lcjCjPc">are.na channel</a>.
                    I also worked on building a tree using an L-system and randomizing the branching to make it look
                    more organic. I tried adding it to the forest sketch I had made previously, to see what it would
                    look like in the different layers of the forest. I also started adding user inputs, but haven't 
                    linked their values to the generator yet. View my sketch <a href="sketches/4-3-22/index.html">here</a>
                    (it takes a long time to load the forest).

                    I played around with the p5 shapes and tried to recreate my instructional drawing
                    from last week <a href="shape/index.html">here</a>. I tried to incorporate the randomness that came out 
                    of the different outputs by having random values for the size of circle, color of circle, and path of the lines.
                    One iteration shown below:

                 <p>
                    The Reference game is very similar to our instructional art in that one person uses language to direct and one person 
                    uses those instructions to draw a design without any further guidance. In the comments and reflections section of the
                     reference game, it discusses how the talker cannot be too general as to have no control, but cannot be too specific 
                     as it could be too narrow and lead to no interpretation from the doer. In building the instructions for my instruction 
                     piece, I found myself balancing those two qualities as well. I didn't want the drawer to get too confused by being 
                     vague with my instructions, but I didn't want to be so specific that each output ends up looking exactly the same.

                <p>I found Yoko Ono's Grapefruit to be interesting, in that some of the instructions 
                    and statements seem to be factual and logical, while other parts seem to be extremely
                    conceptual or even false. For example, the statement "Blood is not red unless exposed", is true
                    but "Grapefruit is a hybrid of lemon and orange" is not true. I wonder what the thought process is
                    for being factual versus more conceptual. Additionally, I found the Tunafish Sandwich 
                    piece to be very intriguing. I would be interested in learning more about how Yoko Ono's mind makes the 
                    connection between imagining thousand suns in the sun, and eating a tunafish sandwich, and what
                    performing those two actions is meant to evoke.

                <p>For my instruction based artwork, I have chosen a piece by Sol Lewitt
                    called Wall Drawing #49, in which the creator is asked to separate the wall 
                    into 15 equal parts, and draw lines using different colors, in different directions
                    for each section.

                <p>In exploring computer art and instruction-based art, I also came across the work of Paul Brown,
                    who made algorithmically generated art, that I thought was interesting because it is computer 
                    generated, but some of the forms look very organic at the same time.

                <p>I found the reading by J.R. Carpenter about the handmade web very interesting. It was fun to look at all the different examples of handmade web linked in the reading. 
                    I was interesting to see how unconventional the aesthetic and the structures of these websites were, especially when I think about how most websites all look the same,
                     with the same basic structure in the current day. In a way, these websites are more innovative than the websites being made today, which makes me feel like we are 
                     moving backwards in the world of web design.

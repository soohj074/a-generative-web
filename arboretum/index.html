  <p>Arboretum is a tool to generate a grove of trees. The appearance of the trees 
    (type of tree, color of leaves, number of branches, and height) will change according
     to the forest type, season, temperature, and age inputs. The initial intention of this
      project was to explore how different environmental factors could affect forest growth, and have 
      that be reflected through the output of generative forests. I was exploring geographical 
      and climate factors, specifically as a way to change the tree appearance. In early iterations, the tool generated many trees to create a 
      forest, but this repetition of the same type of trees took away from the concept of 
      uniquely generated trees, thus the forest became a grove in which each tree is a different species, 
      and more attention can be given to the intricacies of each individual trees. Credit to Daniel Shiffman

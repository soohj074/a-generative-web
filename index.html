                    It is interesting what the reading says about generative art being different from any other traditional 
                    art because of the lack of the human hand being involved in its creation. Because it is computed, it could never 
                    represent anything real. This is confusing when it comes to things like my project, where I generate 
                    something very real - trees, but can never claim to be real

                    I think as more of our current jobs fall subject to automation, new jobs will appear in places we didn't realize jobs could be, 
                    and there will always be a need for human contribution for our society.

                    I made final touches to my <a href="sketches/cluster/index.html">generator</a> such as adding working inputs,
                    and a project description. Users can now use all the inputs to change the type of tree, color of leaves, number of branches, and height.
                    I also added a logo to tie it together.

                    I'm not sure that there will ever be a future where there are no jobs, and humans are just free to do whatever 
                    they want. I think at the end of the day, there has to be someone maintaining the machines that are taking people's 
                    jobs away. And even in this technology boom, there are still so many jobs out there. While some people's jobs 
                    become automated, there are jobs opening up in other areas that couldn't have been there without the existence 
                    of such technology.

                    I <a href="sketches/cluster/index.html">worked</a> on simplifying my forest to just a cluster of trees. I also
                    added a third forest type so that there can be more types of trees, and I adjusted the colors so they compliment
                    eachother better. Additionally, I started building the interface where the generator and outputs will live. I am
                    still working on the styling, but the structure is set.

                    I wonder what the author is alluding to when he talks about art as “material experience” rather than one object 
                    of someone's property. I agree that if we stop viewing art as something someone owns, then it would be impossible to steal, but I'm 
                    unsure about how that would manifest, like would the art be technically everyone's property, or is it something like conditional 
                    design where people partake in the creation of the art so it becomes both the designers work and another person's.

                    I worked on having more variety between my outputs. I added random colors to my leaves. I also added more tree types, and
                    allowed for a random number of forest layers to be generated. I will start to play around more with branch color and thickness,
                    and tree variety to increase the variety between the outputs. See sample outputs below.

                    Its interesting how the reading says that software is not stuck to existing in one form, because I always 
                    thought about it as something stored in a computer and never seen physically. I would never think to print 
                    out code for people to know of its existence, but what the reading says about just having it out there in 
                    many forms makes sense to me. It kind of ties back to accessibility, because not everyone uses computers so
                     heavily, so having the software exist in other forms that those people might come across more will allow 
                     them to become aware of the software too.

                    I found a bunch of resources on different trees that can be generated using L-systems and dumped them in
                    my <a href="https://www.are.na/share/lcjCjPc">are.na channel</a>.
                    For my <a href="sketches/forest/index.html">forest generator</a>, I worked on incorporating a few different
                    tree types using L-systems, using the resources I found. I also started to incorporate leaves into the trees,
                    and randomizing the leaf colors (see sketch image below). For my metadata, I am thinking of including the following user inputs
                    to change the different tree variables:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age of forest → Heights of trees/ Number of trees</li>

                        <li>Season → Color of leaves</li>
                        
                        <li>Forest type → Types of trees</li>

                        <li>Temperature and precipitation → Number of layers/variety of trees</li>

                    It is interesting what the reading says about the power of information play to simulate and predict 
                    phenomena that even God could not predict, and can lead to new behaviors and events
                    <hr>
                    I researched more about L-systems and the different types of trees I would be able to generate.
                    Links to resources I found are on my <a href="https://www.are.na/share/lcjCjPc">are.na channel</a>.
                    I also worked on building a tree using an L-system and randomizing the branching to make it look
                    more organic. I tried adding it to the forest sketch I had made previously, to see what it would
                    look like in the different layers of the forest. I also started adding user inputs, but haven't 
                    linked their values to the generator yet. View my sketch <a href="sketches/4-3-22/index.html">here</a>

                    I resonated with the part where the reading talks about how some languages weren't designed with the 
                    intention of being used for visual art, so the learning curve to be able to use these languages to make 
                    art is very steep. So while code allows us to generate so many things that could never be manually done 
                    by a human, affording limitless possibilities in theory, it can sometimes be hindering because we don't know 
                    technically how to code those things so it is in a way limiting at the same time.

                    For my project concept, I was really inspired by this piece from the reading (see below), 
                    and how a computer can generate something that looks so natural, but is completely computed. I'm interested in replicating something 
                    from nature like trees, because naturally no two trees are the same

                    It is interesting what the reading says about conditional design creating an open system, I agree 
                    with what it says about subjectivity being distributed throughout the system, and how these kinds
                     of open systems act as more of a guide, than strict instructions for a finished piece. I wonder 
                     though if that is really an improvement from a closed system, in which the entire design is subjective
                      to the designer. If the designer is setting the parameters for certain inputs, the outputs could still
                       be fairly subjective, because the designer is deciding the limits to what the outputs look like, but 
                       I guess if the system is less rigid then it will be more open to variation.

                    I played around with the p5 shapes and tried to recreate my instructional drawing
                    from last week <a href="shape/index.html">here</a>. I tried to incorporate the randomness that came out 
                    of the different outputs by having random values for the size of circle, color of circle, and path of the lines.

                    The Reference game is very similar to our instructional art in that one person uses language to direct and one person 
                    uses those instructions to draw a design without any further guidance. In the comments and reflections section of the
                     reference game, it discusses how the talker cannot be too general as to have no control, but cannot be too specific 
                     as it could be too narrow and lead to no interpretation from the doer. In building the instructions for my instruction 
                     piece, I found myself balancing those two qualities as well. I didn't want the drawer to get too confused by being 
                     vague with my instructions, but I didn't want to be so specific that each output ends up looking exactly the same.

                <p>I found Yoko Ono's Grapefruit to be interesting, in that some of the instructions 
                    and statements seem to be factual and logical, while other parts seem to be extremely
                    conceptual or even false. For example, the statement "Blood is not red unless exposed", is true
                    but "Grapefruit is a hybrid of lemon and orange" is not true. I wonder what the thought process is
                    for being factual versus more conceptual. Additionally, I found the Tunafish Sandwich 
                    piece to be very intriguing. I would be interested in learning more about how Yoko Ono's mind makes the 
                    connection between imagining thousand suns in the sun, and eating a tunafish sandwich, and what
                    performing those two actions is meant to evoke.
